README.md

This repository contains a minimal Playwright + Apify page function
used to reliably capture screenshots from JavaScript-heavy websites.

The output key name (`screenshot`) is kept as-is to match
an existing downstream automation pipeline (Make), and can be easily
renamed if reused in other contexts.
